Fishing app:
  I want to be able to:
    Before fishing trips:
      Check weather information: Wind Speed, Wave height, rain/temperatures/barametric air pressure
        Wunderground API.
      Look at local fishing reports
    After fishing:
      Record fishing trip information:
        Record actual water temps, locations fished, fish caught, any other observations
        Upload pictures of our trips

I will implement this using the MEAN stack minus MongoDB. In its stead I will use
PostgresSQL.
